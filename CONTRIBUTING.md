# Contribution Guidelines

We're in the early stages of development but it's best to set a few guidelines to ensure some consistency.

Before creating a Pull Request ensure that that there is an assocaited GitHub issue.

## _Best Practice_

* Branches should be of format ```mp-<issue-number>-<additional-text>``` ex. ```mp-3-repository-management```
* Commits should be descriptive
